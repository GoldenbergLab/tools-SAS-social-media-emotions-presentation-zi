Upon meeting someone for the first time, it can be hard to work out what kind of person they are. That’s why reading people helps you understand them more accurately. The cues are always there, you just need to look for them!

Your ability to read people on sight will affect how you deal with them. Thus, the more accurately you read them, the more effective your communication will be. So, if you want to read people, you need to pay attention to everything. From someone’s eye contact to their smile, from their head movements to their posture, down to their shoes.

While reading people or their body language isn’t easy, if you can do it, it’s a great skill to have. Of course, everyone is different, so your interpretation of them may or may not always be accurate. But, if you want to know more about how to read anyone instantly, definitely give these psychological tips a go!

There are many different types of manipulation techniques and they are often used for persuasion, deception, and control. If you've ever felt like someone was trying to control you, then you've experienced the effects of dark psychology tactics, or the manipulation of human behavior to get a desired result.

In this video, we go over what psychological and emotional manipulation techniques are and how they work; how you can recognize them in everyday life; and how you can avoid falling victim to these kinds of tactics yourself!

We highlight some of the most common manipulation tactics that narcissists, psychopaths, and sociopaths use on their victims, particularly in close relationships. But they are also frequently employed by companies, organization, politicians and mass media. Now, that’s not to suggest that you should get caught in the trap of always thinking about how you could be manipulated, but it’s important to be aware.

To partake in the journey of discovering who we truly are, it is necessary for us to know our true and authentic personality. The quest to know ourselves allows us to better understand the complexity and intricacies of the human condition, improve our relationship with ourselves, with others, and with the world. 

Carl Jung’s model of typology is not a system of character analysis, nor is it a way of labelling oneself or others. Much as one might use a compass to determine where one is in the physical world, Jung’s typology is a tool for psychological orientation. 

The main aspects are the attitude types: extraversion and introversion, and the psychological functions: feeling, thinking, sensation and intuition.

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- Never start your request with the words ""Could you..."" It can cause the other person to subconsciously assume that this is a theoretical question
- If you ever want someone to feel uncomfortable, look at the middle of their forehead during the conversation.
- If someone you're talking to is trying to avoid answering a question, just make a pause in the conversation while still keeping eye contact.
- When asking a question that you want an affirmative answer to, try to nod subtly as you make your request. This trick is often used by restaurants employees to make guests buy more food, and it’s pretty effective! 
- If a person is really concentrated on a task (let's say they're in the middle of a serious phone conversation), you can extend your hand to them and get anything they’re holding at the moment.
- If you want somebody to do something for you, casually say how they probably wouldn’t even be able to do it. Most people will try really hard to prove someone wrong when it comes to doubting their capabilities.
- Here’s a good one for negotiations. If you like a person's offer in general but would like to get better conditions, pretend to be a little bit disappointed.
- As soon as your alarm clock goes off, sit up, make two fists, and yell ""Yeah!"" as if you’re a soccer player who's just scored a goal. It sounds bizarre, but it really does help you easily get out of bed feeling refreshed.
- If a person tries to pull you into an argument or some drama, say something nice to them. The ol’ “kill ‘em with kindness” trick really does stop them in their tracks.
- If you have that one lazy person on your team that slows the whole work process down, don't give them tasks by saying ""Do this."" It’s better to say ""Start with this.""
- If someone is staring at you in the subway (happens all-too often, right?), just look at their shoes. Don't give up, keep gazing! It’ll drive them crazy!
- If someone has done something wrong, but you don’t wanna sound too accusing, change the way you construct your sentences.
- If you didn't get a good night's sleep, tell yourself that you did. I know, it sounds like nonsense, but it does work 100% if you say it with meaning!
- People are better at remembering what happened at the beginning and end of the day. As for anything that went on in between, it gets blurry.

Narcissism isn’t just a personality type that shows up in advice columns; it’s actually a set of traits classified and studied by psychologists. But what causes it? And can narcissists improve on their negative traits? W. Keith Campbell describes the psychology behind the elevated and sometimes detrimental self-involvement of narcissists.

Often, it is associated with one of - if not THE - highest deity in each religion (Christian Trinity, Egyptian Trinity, Supernal Triad in Kabbalah, etc). Is there a reason for this? Or is it a coincidence? The psychoanalyst tradition has some things to say about this occurrence, and their discoveries might not only blow your mind, but disturb you.

Seduction is a game of psychology, not beauty, and it is within the grasp of any person to become a master at the game.

A seducer does not turn the power off and on—every social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction. There is never a moment to waste.

Seducers are never self-absorbed. Their gaze is directed outward, not inward. Pleasure is a feeling of being taken past our limits, of being overwhelmed—by another person, by an experience.
Finally, seducers are completely amoral in their approach to life.

🎓 ABOUT ROBERT GREENE:

Robert Greene is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, and The 50th Law. His highly anticipated fifth book, Mastery, examines the lives of great historical figures such as Charles Darwin, Mozart, Paul Graham and Henry Ford and distills the traits and universal ingredients that made them masters.

People often wonder about things such as: Why do we dream? What do dreams mean? How does dreaming work? What is dreaming? Well, these are just some of the questions this video explores! Psychology and neuroscience have discovered a lot about dreaming through sleep studies conducted in the REM sleep stage, and they were able to provide some truly fascinating answers to these questions.

In this video, we talk about the brain’s electrical activity during sleep, subconscious messages in a dream, negative emotions, as well as some common dreams and their meanings. We brush upon premonition dreams, dreaming in black and white, lucid dreaming, and a lot more!

Get ready to discover some the most interesting facts about dream psychology!

Trickster is witty and deceitful. He is the timeless root of all the picaresque creations of world literature, and is not reducible to one single literary entity. Trickster tales have existed since ancient times, and has been said to be at the very foundation of civilisation and culture. They belong to the oldest expressions of mankind. 

Tricksters are the breakers of rules, agents of mischief, masters of deceit, and boundary crossers. He is an agent of change, and is amoral, not immoral.

Trickster is at one and the same time creator and destroyer, giver and negator, he who dupes and who is always duped himself. 

Psychologically, the trickster is an archetype, part of the collective unconscious. Trickster is everywhere, he is an eternal state of mind. 

The integration of the trickster archetype allows us to go from being ruled by our own self-centred ego to a new way of living, in which one has integrity and relatedness. It allows us to become aware of our true emotions, behaviours, and thoughts, that our unconscious persona is hiding, and without which there is no individuation at all.

Seduction is a game of psychology, not beauty, and it is within the grasp of any person to become a master at the game.

A seducer does not turn the power off and on—every social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction. There is never a moment to waste.

Seducers are never self-absorbed. Their gaze is directed outward, not inward. Pleasure is a feeling of being taken past our limits, of being overwhelmed—by another person, by an experience.
Finally, seducers are completely amoral in their approach to life.

🎓 ABOUT ROBERT GREENE:

Robert Greene is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, and The 50th Law. His highly anticipated fifth book, Mastery, examines the lives of great historical figures such as Charles Darwin, Mozart, Paul Graham and Henry Ford and distills the traits and universal ingredients that made them masters.

It is the archetype at the bottom of all genuine healing procedures. As long as we feel victimised, bitter and resentful towards our wound, and seek to escape from suffering it, we remain inescapably bound to it. This is neurotic suffering, as opposed to the authentic suffering of the wounded healer which is purified. The wound can destroy you, or it can wake you up.  As Carl Jung wrote, ""The doctor is effective only when he himself is affected. Only the wounded physician heals.""

Up next, Why Americans don’t trust each other ► https://youtu.be/E4erHIZpnyQ

Collective illusions — false assumptions about society that many people share — have existed for thousands of years in many different ways. Today, because of social media and modern technology, they have become even more common.

One example of a collective illusion is the commonly held belief that everyone wants fame, wealth, and power. That’s not true. Most of us want lives of purpose and meaning. But because of false assumptions, many of us spend our lives chasing things that won’t fulfill us.

Another example of a collective illusion is the pervasive idea that the U.S. is an irredeemably divided nation. Sure, Americans have plenty of disagreements. But fundamentally, they have more in common than they might think.

As former Harvard professor and bestselling author Todd Rose explains, the antidote to collective illusions is becoming a more authentic individual, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of how our innate drive to conform to social norms often works against that.

Give Paul Bloom one hour, and he'll teach you ""the psychology of everything."" Through the case studies of compassion, racism, and sex, Dr. Bloom explores the intrinsic fundamentals of human nature, including some of our most intriguing tendencies, such as the kindness of babies, stereotyping (which can be both detrimental and beneficial), and our universal sense of beauty. Additional topics addressed in the lecture include: ""What do studies suggest is the number one characteristic that males and females look for in a mate?"", ""How can I get someone to have compassion for causes I care about?"", ""Are we all unconscious racists?"", and even, ""What do the porn preferences of monkeys tells us about our own sexual choices?""

TRANSCRIPT:

Hello, my name is Paul Bloom and I’m a Professor of Psychology at Yale University.  And what I want to do today is present a brief introduction to psychology, which is the science of the human mind.  

Now, I’m admittedly biased, but I think psychology is the most interesting of all scientific fields.  It’s the most interesting because it’s about us.  It’s about the most important and intimate aspects of our lives.  So psychologists study everything from language, perception, memory, motivation, dreams, love, hate.  We study the development of a child.  We study mental illnesses like schizophrenia and psychopathy, we study morality, we study happiness. 

Now, psychology is such a huge field that it breaks up into different subfields.  Some psychologists study neuroscience, which is the study how the brain gives rise to mental life.  Others, like me, are Developmental Psychologists.  We study what happens to make a baby turn into a child and a child turn into adults.  We study what makes a baby turn into a child and a child turn into an adult.  We ask questions like, how does a baby think about the world?  What do we start off knowing?  What do we have to learn?  

Other psychologists are Social Psychologists. They study human interaction.  What’s the nature of prejudice?  How do we persuade one another? 

Some Psychologists are Cognitive Psychologists.  What that means is they study the mind as a computational device looking particularly at capacities like language, perception, memory, and decision-making.  Some Psychologists are Evolutionary Psychologists, which means they’re particularly interested in biological origin of the human mind.  

There are Evolutionary Psychologists.  Evolutionary Psychologists are particularly interested in the evolutionary origin of our psychologies.  So they study the mind with an eye towards how it has evolved.  What adaptive problems it’s been constructed to solve.  

Finally, there’s clinical psychology.  For many people, this is what psychology means.  Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology, and in fact, it’s a very important aspect of psychology.  Clinical psychologists are interested in the diagnosis that the causes and the treatment of mental disorders, disorders like schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders.  It would be impossible for me to provide a full spectrum introduction to all of these sub fields of psychology in the time I have.  

So what I’m going to do instead is I’m going to focus on three case studies. I’m gong to focus on compassion, racism, and sex.  I’ve chosen these case studies for two reasons.  First, each of them is particularly interesting in its own light.  These are questions we’re interested in as people, as scientists, but also in our every day lives.  And I want to try to persuade you that psychologists have some interesting things to say about them.  

Second, together they illustrate the range of approaches that psychologists use.  The sort of theories that we construct, the sorts of methods we use when approaching a domain.  I want to try to give you a feeling for what psychology looks like when we actually carry it out.  

The first case study is compassion.  Compassion...

Swiss psychiatrist and psychologist Jung discovered alchemy and devoted the remaining 30 years of his life to studying it, which he practically dug up from the dunghill of the past, for it was considered pseudoscience, a forgotten relic of history and despised field of investigation which he had suddenly revived. 

Alchemy allows one to achieve wholeness through a reconnection with the unconscious. For Jung, the task of alchemy was and has always been psychological. The end product is not material in nature, but rather spiritual. Alchemy is the art of expanding consciousness, of self-realisation.

Up next, Why Americans don’t trust each other ► https://youtu.be/E4erHIZpnyQ

Collective illusions — false assumptions about society that many people share — have existed for thousands of years in many different ways. Today, because of social media and modern technology, they have become even more common.

One example of a collective illusion is the commonly held belief that everyone wants fame, wealth, and power. That’s not true. Most of us want lives of purpose and meaning. But because of false assumptions, many of us spend our lives chasing things that won’t fulfill us.

Another example of a collective illusion is the pervasive idea that the U.S. is an irredeemably divided nation. Sure, Americans have plenty of disagreements. But fundamentally, they have more in common than they might think.

As former Harvard professor and bestselling author Todd Rose explains, the antidote to collective illusions is becoming a more authentic individual, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of how our innate drive to conform to social norms often works against that.

21:11 Myth: America is on the verge of civil war

55,55.0,38hwk0BgGNU,Eternalised,UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA,1663294544.0,The Psychology of The Trickster,"There is perhaps no figure in literature more fascinating than the trickster, appearing in various forms in the folklore of many cultures. Trickster is witty and deceitful. He is the timeless root of all the picaresque creations of world literature, and is not reducible to one single literary entity. Trickster tales have existed since ancient times, and has been said to be at the very foundation of civilisation and culture. They belong to the oldest expressions of mankind. 

Tricksters are the breakers of rules, agents of mischief, masters of deceit, and boundary crossers. He is an agent of change, and is amoral, not immoral.

Trickster is at one and the same time creator and destroyer, giver and negator, he who dupes and who is always duped himself. 

Psychologically, the trickster is an archetype, part of the collective unconscious. Trickster is everywhere, he is an eternal state of mind. 

The integration of the trickster archetype allows us to go from being ruled by our own self-centred ego to a new way of living, in which one has integrity and relatedness. It allows us to become aware of our true emotions, behaviours, and thoughts, that our unconscious persona is hiding, and without which there is no individuation at all.

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright break down what causes Tony's breakdown in Iron Man 3, how he gets through it, and how that relates to real life trauma or anxiety. They also talk about Tony's narcissism, problem-solving, and relationships. And how Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man launched the Marvel franchise and changed the landscape of modern movies.

But we can all become more skilled in our relationships be they in the domains of friendship, romance, work or career. Deploying the psychological principles behind seduction, the author of a new book on dysfunctional love - 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' - explains how improving how seductive you are, will also lead to benefits across many other aspects of your life, beyond just romance.

Raj Persaud is a Consultant Psychiatrist who has written and broadcast widely in the mainstream media besides working as an academic and clinical psychiatrist, achieving the senior post of NHS Consultant Psychiatrist at the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Hospitals from 1994-2008. He has won numerous academic distinctions including the Royal College of Psychiatrist’s Research Prize and Medal and holds amongst 8 degrees and diplomas including a First Class Honours degree in Psychology.

Swiss psychiatrist and psychologist Jung discovered alchemy and devoted the remaining 30 years of his life to studying it, which he practically dug up from the dunghill of the past, for it was considered pseudoscience, a forgotten relic of history and despised field of investigation which he had suddenly revived. 

Alchemy allows one to achieve wholeness through a reconnection with the unconscious. For Jung, the task of alchemy was and has always been psychological. The end product is not material in nature, but rather spiritual. Alchemy is the art of expanding consciousness, of self-realisation.

Can fear ever be a good thing? For Bruce Wayne, his fear and grief are motivators for the good he does.

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright discuss Christian Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his journey to not be defined by his grief, fear, or failures, but to use them to do good and help others. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy helps us explore how we can challenge our fears and anxieties, develop and maintain our morality in the face of difficult circumstances, and move through persistent and complex grief. These films are thematically rich, visually stunning, have a fabulous score, and give Jonathan a chance to show off with big words like chiroptophobia.

It doesn’t come easy. It’s hard work & has to be nurtured daily. Don’t let mistrust creep into the equation. Don’t give your spouse reason to mistrust you. Once trust is broken, it will not be the same again. 

When talking about marriage, Allah says your spouses are garments for you. A garment may not fit perfectly but either way, it covers imperfections, protects, and beautifies. Its easy for a woman to submit where she is taken care of and is easy for a man to love where he's respected.

Chad Ripperger | Chris Stefanick Show,"And as exorcist Fr. Chad Ripperger tells us this week, the Evil One hates when we stay positive in the face of hardships. When we set our sights on the good, the demons are forced to flee. Fr. Ripperger has seen this happen with the possessed people he has worked with, but it can work for all of us. We should all make positivity a part of our everyday spiritual lives. Join me and find out how to do just that.

What is your center and how do you find it? How do you go from isolation to belonging?

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are talking about finding your center (purpose) by following Jack Frost’s hero journey in Rise of the Guardians. They discuss Jack’s transition from isolation to becoming a Guardian. Alan complains about Jack’s magic frost powers and memory loss not making sense and why Chris Pine was miscast, while Jono tries to ship Elsa and Jack Frost… Alan doesn’t like that either. But he does love Alec Baldwin's Russian Santa!

The Psychology OF A Man During The No Contact Rule 

In this video, we’re going to be talking about the psychology of a man during the No Contact Rule 
- Calm and assured of their decision 
- Worry after they don’t hear from you 
- Anger after they’ve realized they’re being ignored 
- Confrontation about what they lost 
- Hope for contact 

Basically, I'm going to tell you exactly what goes on in their heads, when you do the No Contact Rule their thoughts, feelings and time lines, How long? What’s going on? 

There are three timelines when implementing the No Contact Rule, these are the 21, 30 and 45 days No Contact. So, what is happening to the person you’re doing the No Contact to day by day, stage by stage.  

Basing this on the 30 day No Contact, now these stages are similar to the 5 stages of grief.  

What I'm going to do is explain what each of the stages are, what you can expect to be going on in your exes' mind, time frame when you can expect these stages to occur.  

5 Stages  

Stage #1 – Calm and assured of their decision 
So, you can expect stage 1 to occur from 3 days to a week. So most often your’e the victim of the break up and your ex has broken up with you. They think they’ve made the right decision.  

Stage #2 – They get worried when they don’t hear from you 
You can typically expect this stage to last from one week to two weeks into a No Contact Rule. They begin to worry as they don’t hear from you, this is an odd type of behaviour.  

Where most people in relationships establish what I call patterns, specifically communication patterns, they often talk at certain times of the day.  

When that pattern is interrupted, they notice, but specifically they begin to worry a little bit and think what’s going on here. 

 Stage #3 – They get angry after they realized they’re being ignored 
This stage typically lasts anywhere from two weeks to two and a half weeks into the No Contact Rule. 

So, about half way through your No Contact you and expect a flip in the situation where you ex maybe cordial about reaching out to you before.  

They now start to get angry and re affirm their decision to break up with you and often tell you about that.  

They usually say something hurtful, because you’re not responding to them, because you’re breaking the communication patter. You’re not acting in a way that is socially acceptable in their frame of mind. 

Stage #4 - A confrontation about what they lost 
At this point they will reach a point where they realize, I may have lost her forever, the reason they think this is when they break up with you, they seem themselves as on a pedestal.  

They’re higher than you.  

That you will want them back, whenever they want to get back with you, 

But, after you flipped that on its head by using the No Contact Rule, they realize that they may have lost you forever, creating a fear of loss. 

Stage #5 – Hope of contact 
This can typically be from 3 weeks to the end of 4 weeks. After going through the first four stages, they go through a rollercoaster of emotions, but now they start to hope for contact from you. 

Because they don’t like looking at life without you. The more interesting you become. 

Take note! 
Some exes can go through these stages differently, some skip stages and some don’t show any of these stages at all. This is commonly what you can expect your ex to go through during a No Contact Rule.

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright talk about what it means to be a hero, to have integrity, to stay loyal to your principles and the people that matter to you. They look at Steve Rogers' journey from pure altruism to enlightened self interest (all while still staying true to himself and keeping his integrity), and how his journey is in some ways the opposite of Tony Stark's (see what we have to say about Iron Man here: https://youtu.be/WabG3H-QnFw )

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are breaking down 8 lessons for healthy masculinity through Rocky Balboa. Like Aragorn, he displays healthy masculinity, but he’s also humble, tender, strong, and teachable. They discuss how Rocky is a classic underdog story and probably the first to do it well. The character means a lot to Jonathan because of the valuable lessons about love, family, grief, and getting back up when life knocks you down. The training montages and frolicking in short shorts are a bonus.

His areas of expertise are social, health, sport and exercise psychology. He is involved in numerous research projects nationally and internationally with a focus on motivation and behaviour change. He is currently leading projects in drugs in sport, promoting physical activity and healthy diet, understanding the mechanisms of willpower and self-control, and reducing binge drinking and the prevalence of smoking.

At the highest level, athletes are well-matched in terms of their physical abilities, conditioning, and skill level. But often that is not enough to win and perform on the biggest of stages like the Olympic games. Developing strategies and techniques to get athletes minds in the best possible condition for optimal performance is increasingly important for sports teams and coaches.

Martin will provide an overview of the kinds of techniques that elite athletes use to prepare psychologically for their sport, give details of the scientific research into these techniques and how they work, and how the techniques might be used by competitive athetes and coaches to maximise performance.

About TEDx, x = independently organised event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organised events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organised events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organised TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organised.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",17.0,1852201.0,422.0,22070.0,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yG7v4y_xwzQ/hqdefault.jpg,Sport Psychology|tedx talk|English|Sandbox|ted talk|Martin Hagger|TEDxPerth|Octagon|tedx talks|tedx|ted x|Perth|Western Australia|ted|Australia|UWA|2012|ted talks|WA,2023-03-10 09:37:18.544977,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.245, 'compound': 0.5994}",0.0,0.245,0.755,0.5994,"{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.9837}",0.012,0.117,0.871,0.9837,"{'fear': 0.0, 'anger': 0.0, 'anticip': 0.0, 'trust': 0.25, 'surprise': 0.0, 'positive': 0.25, 'negative': 0.0, 'sadness': 0.0, 'disgust': 0.0, 'joy': 0.25, 'anticipation': 0.25}",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25

“I’m now 57 years old, and a lot of people are dead at 57. I look at this problem with complete fascination. You all have to face it. We’re all going to evaporate and turn into bones and dust. Instead of avoiding that, instead of looking the other way, instead of saying, ‘Oh, well, later…’ Let’s look at it! What would it be like to go to sleep and never wake up?” – Alan Watts

Description:

Between 1889 and 1930 there were around 3,700 known lynchings in the US. The perpetrators ranged from single people to small mobs to huge crowds of 15,000. The reasons given were broad. While most were accused of murder of rape, many were lynched for simply being rude, for arguing, for taking the wrong job or having the wrong beliefs.

Like during Holocaust, as I explored in a previous video, these were ‘ordinary men’ and women, and often even children. 

And as in my exploration of the psychology of the perpetrators' Holocaust, I want to try and understand the factors that led both to the violence of lynchings, but also ask how ordinary Americans justified their racism more broadly. 

I want to use lynchings to try and examine racism more broadly, taking an action, an event, and slowly zooming outwards, looking at the psychological, sociological, and historical conditions that led to it.

We’ll look at a number of what I’ll describe in as ‘justifications, rationalizations, or causes’ – to try to understand what led to violence, and how the beliefs, attitudes, and psychologies of perpetrators were produced more broadly. 

We’ll look at propaganda, sexuality, scientific racism, nostalgia, economics, stereotypes,  and first, the power of a feeling of defeat and victimhood, on the part of whites.

Many of us will experience some kind of trauma during our lifetime. Sometimes, we escape with no long-term effects. But for millions of people, those experiences linger, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and negative thoughts that interfere with everyday life. Joelle Rabow Maletis details the science behind post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

-----------------------------------------

Discover more on our website: http://www.psychologyunlocked.com/strange-situation/
-----------------------------------------
She called it the Strange Situation Classification, and it is widely referred to as simply the Strange Situation.

As an adult you know when you’ve formed an attachment with someone; you know how it feels and you know how to express your feelings in words. However, when it comes to babies and young children they haven’t yet developed these skills and therefore researchers must turn to more subtle techniques.
-----------------------------------------
REALLY USEFUL PSYCHOLOGY TEXTBOOK: https://amzn.to/397QCm9 (Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour, 7th ed., Richard Gross)
-----------------------------------------
Such as the Strange Situation, which measures the security of an attachment in 1 to 2 year olds; a twenty minute participatory observation, during which the researcher observes the infant’s behavioural responses to a series of scenarios.

Ainsworth’s strange situation includes eight stages, each lasting roughly 3 minutes:

Stage 1: Mother and Baby
Stage 2: Mother, Baby and Stranger
Stage 3: Stranger and Baby
Stage 4: Mother returns
Stage 5: Stranger leaves
Stage 6: Mother leaves, leaving baby alone
Stage 7: Stranger returns
Stage 8: Mother returns and stranger leaves

So what were the researchers measuring? When the mother was in the room with the baby, they scored the infant’s behaviour on four measures:

Proximity and contact-seeking; Contact maintaining; Avoidance of proximity and contact; and resistance to contact and comforting. The baby’s exploratory behaviours were also recorded as they explored the environment.
-----------------------------------------
ALSO WATCH THIS: https://youtu.be/gxEMkOtB8tM (How People Learn: Pavlov's Study of Conditioning)
-----------------------------------------
Ainsworth reported that infants display one of three attachment types:

Securely attached infants showed distress when separated from their mother, were avoidant of the stranger when alone but friendly in the presence of their mother, and were happy when the mother returned from outside the room. Seventy percent of children studied fell into this category.

Fifteen percent of children demonstrated an ambivalent attachment with their mother. These children showed intense distress when the mother left the room, and demonstrated a significant fear of the stranger. When the mother returned to the room, ambivalent children approached the mother but rejected contact.

Ainsworth reported that a final fifteen percent had an avoidant attachment style. Such infants show no interest when the mother leaves the room and play happily with the stranger. When the mother returns, avoidant children barely seem to notice.

In 1990, Main and Solomon added that a very small percentage were inconstant in their behaviours and defined this attachment style as disorganised. 

Ainsworth’s caregiver sensitivity hypothesis suggests that differences in infants’ attachment styles are dependent on the mother’s behaviour towards the baby during a critical period of development.

Tony Stark can think his way out of almost any problem, but what happens when he can't? Or when he can't protect the people he cares about?

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright finish out Tony Stark's character arc in part 2 of this deep dive into the psychology of Iron Man. They talk about handling guilt, dealing with trauma, and building and repairing relationships. And the absolutely stellar writing in the MCU, and stunning performances from Robert Downey Jr, Tom Holland, and more.

Are you want to learn the secrets of influencing people and getting what you want? In this video, we'll be discussing the psychology behind how to influence people and always get what you want. Whether you're trying to persuade someone to see things from your perspective, or simply negotiate a better deal for yourself, understanding the science behind human behaviour can make a huge difference. We'll go over various techniques and strategies you can use to influence people, such as reciprocity, social proof, and scarcity, and explain how they work in the context of everyday life.  By the end of this video, you'll have a better understanding of how to use psychology to your advantage and get what you want in any situation.

More than a thousand studies suggest that a major part of the answer is learning psychological flexibility. Steven C. Hayes is one of the researchers who first identified that process and put it into action in the form of a popular acceptance and mindfulness method called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. In this emotional talk, Hayes distills the essence of psychological flexibility down into a few easy to understand sentences. He takes viewers through a harrowing journey into his own panic disorder, to the very moment in his life when he made this life changing choice: I will not run from me. Hayes shows how making that choice allows us to connect with our own deep sense of meaning and purpose, arguing that taking a loving stance to your own pain allows you to bring love and contribution into the world.

Steven C. Hayes is Nevada Foundation Professor at the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. An author of 38 books and more than 540 scientific articles, he has shown in his research how language and thought leads to human suffering, and has developed “Acceptance and Commitment Therapy” a powerful therapy method that is useful in a wide variety of areas. His popular book “Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life” was featured in Time Magazine among several other major media outlets and for a time was the number one best selling self-help book in the United States. Dr. Hayes has been President of several scientific societies and has received several national awards, such as the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Video Summary:
The Psychology of Selling Step #1: Drop the enthusiasm.
This is my biggest passion in the sales training space today. Salespeople need to drop the enthusiasm. It’s time to get rid of the excitement when you’re in front of prospects.

The Psychology of Selling Step #2: Stop pitching.Recent sales data shows that one of the biggest reasons that prospects and buyers don’t ultimately choose to do business with a salesperson is that they felt the salesperson didn’t really understand their needs.
                     
The Psychology of Selling Step #3: Pressure is a no-no.Grown-ups are always telling kids that bad behavior is a “no-no”—and this is exactly how I feel about pressure in sales. Never, ever apply pressure to your prospects in a selling situation.                      

The Psychology of Selling Step #4: It’s about them, not you.I once had a boss that used to say, “Prospects listen to one radio station, and that one radio station is WIIFM.” Now, do you know what WIIFM stands for? What’s in it for me.
                     
The Psychology of Selling Step #5: Step into their shoes.Some really powerful data has shown that top performers are much more effective at taking the perspectives of their buyers. When’s the last time you really thought about the experience your buyers go through when talking to you? What about when they talk to your competitors?                     

The Psychology of Selling Step #6: Create value through questions.If you've ever watched the show “The Sopranos” then you remember those conversations between Tony Soprano and his psychologist. Did you ever notice how the psychologist never proposes a solution to his problems? 
                     
The Psychology of Selling Step #7: “No” isn’t bad.Let me repeat that: “No” isn’t bad. This is such an important part of the psychology of selling. Most salespeople spend their entire careers trying to avoid any type of rejection. But in reality, hearing “no” isn’t a bad thing at all. You see, our data shows that at least 50% of your prospects are not a good fit for what you sell.

The Psychology of Selling Step #8: If you feel, say it.One of my mentors always used to say this, and it stuck with me because it’s great advice. In today’s selling environment, there’s just no time to waste with tire-kickers or people who aren’t a good fit.                     

The Psychology of Selling Step #9: Get deep into their challenges.This is something I’ve been saying for years. Salespeople need to start thinking like doctors, and stop thinking like typical salespeople. The key is to get deep into prospects’ challenges. Most salespeople just identify a surface-level challenge and then immediately offer a solution.
                     
The Psychology of Selling Step #10: Tie their challenges to value.We’ve talked about going deeper to really understand what’s going on in your prospects’ world. Now you want to make sure you’re tying their challenges to a specific value. 

The Psychology of Selling Step #11: Make it a two-way dialogue.The psychology of selling shows us that when people are actually speaking, they’re the most engaged. When they’re listening, they may still be engaged in the conversation, but it’s less likely.                      

The Psychology of Selling Step #12: Budget comes later.This is one of the most important elements in the psychology of selling. You never want to begin your sales conversations talking about price or money. This budget discussion should come at the end of the discovery process.
                                          
The Psychology of Selling Step #13: Use feedback loops. I said earlier that it’s important to make your presentation a two-way dialogue. Feedback loops are the most effective way to do this. These are little questions to ask when you’re talking to prospects that will pull them back into the conversation.

So, there you have it. That’s the psychology of selling in 13 steps to selling that actually works. I want to hear from you. Which of these ideas did you find most useful?

The only reason you’re here, reading this, is because there is an unbroken chain leading back from you to the origin of life itself. In nature, adaptations shaped by environments to solve the problems of survival and mating: Endless forms of beautiful complexity like echolocation, courtship dances, and lactation. For millions of years we’ve had to find food, find mates and take care of our children and for hundreds of thousands of years we’ve used language to communicate, made tools, formed societies and shared our cultural innovations. Evolutionary psychology sees the human mind as shaped by the problems we faced over and over again throughout our deep history. According to evolutionary psychologists nothing about human nature makes sense except in light of evolution.

The endless forms in the human mind include emotions, thought patterns, perceptions, and social interactions which can be discovered and examined by investigating their possible function in solving problems of survival and reproduction. 

Evolutionary psychology has had a massive influence on the field of psychology and the public’s perception of the human mind. But detractors also criticise evolutionary psychology for being biologically determinist, reactionary, and lacking falsifiability and scientific rigour. This talk will introduce you to the field of evolutionary psychology, its foundational principles and methods as well as common misunderstandings, questions and legitimate concerns.

Diana Fleischman, PhD is a Senior Lecturer in Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Portsmouth. After an internship at a chimpanzee research facility, Diana earned her PhD in evolutionary psychology at the University of Texas at Austin studying hormonal influences on disgust sensitivity.

After two research positions, one investigating handwashing and the other looking at hormonal influences on women’s psychology, Diana arrived at Portsmouth where she researches disgust and teaches a course on the Psychology of Human Sexuality. Diana is currently working on a popular book applying evolutionary psychology and animal training to romantic relationships. You can follow Diana on twitter @sentientist.

Have you heard the story about Ronald Read, the janitor that had 8 million dollars in savings when he died in 2014? Yes, you heard that right. Janitor. $8 millions. And he didn´t win the lottery or inherit the money either. He just saved consistently throughout his life, while letting the wonders of compounding do its thing. The morale is that your behaviour with money is oftentimes more important than how intelligent you are. Even if you don´t have a diploma from Harvard, or work on Wall Street, you can become rich by just behaving in a sound way. As Morgan Housel puts it: “financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.” Spend your next ten or fifteen minutes on this video, and you might excel on the soft skill of investing! This is a top 5 takeaways summary of The Psychology of Money, by Morgan Housel.

My goal with this channel is to help you make more money and improve your personal finances. How to become a millionaire? There are many ways to get there – investing in the stock market, becoming a stock trader, doing real estate investing, or why not becoming an entrepreneur? But whether you are interested in how to invest in stocks or investing strategies for creating passive income with rental properties – I hope to be able to provide you with a solution (or at least an idea) here. Warren Buffett - the greatest investor of our time - says that you should fill your mind with competing ideas and then see what makes sense to you. This channel is about filling your mind with those ideas. And in the process – upgrading your money-making toolbox.",27.0,3143504.0,1785.0,76610.0,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TJDcGv9OH4Q/hqdefault.jpg,The Psychology of Money|Morgan Housel|Behavioural finance|Twitter|Value investing|Charlie Munger|Buffett|Investing 101|Investing in your 20s|Stock market|Invest|How to start investing|Warren Buffett|Benjamin Graham|Book summary|Online investing|Wall Street|ETFs|Money|how to make money|passive income|how to invest|personal finance|investing|investing for beginners|how to invest in stocks|investing strategies|the Swedish investor,2023-03-10 09:37:21.262212,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9891}",0.016,0.119,0.866,0.9891,"{'fear': 0.0, 'anger': 0.0, 'anticip': 0.0, 'trust': 0.0, 'surprise': 0.0, 'positive': 0.0, 'negative': 0.0, 'sadness': 0.0, 'disgust': 0.0, 'joy': 0.0}",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They have presented Dr Peterson with an ultimatum: take part in re-education courses aiming to correct his “wrongthink,” or lose his clinical psychology license. 

Here is the promised documentation for the current charges and justification for the sentence already handed down by the College of Psychologists: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12XBZtXwsEZpXT7J7_-aFQQ1mTvvj4loW/view

Mikhaila Peterson is a CEO and the host of “The Mikhaila Peterson Podcast.” As well as interviews, she hosts a series called Opposing Views, where she speaks to people with differing opinions on contentious issues to let listeners make up their own minds. She’s used a diet called the Lion Diet to heal from autoimmune and mood disorders and has educated people on that diet via TEDx and Oxford Union speeches.

Mikhaila is also the founder of the upcoming online education platform Peterson Academy, an online education place devoid of ideology, launching in 2023.

Dr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

In this highly acclaimed New York Times bestseller, Dr. Robert B. Cialdini—the seminal expert in the field of influence and persuasion—explains the psychology of why people say yes and how to apply these principles ethically in business and everyday situations.

You’ll learn the six universal principles of influence and how to use them to become a skilled persuader—and, just as importantly, how to defend yourself against dishonest influence attempts:

Reciprocation: The internal pull to repay what another person has provided us.
Commitment and Consistency: Once we make a choice or take a stand, we work to behave consistently with that commitment in order to justify our decisions.
Social Proof: When we are unsure, we look to similar others to provide us with the correct actions to take. And the more, people undertaking that action, the more we consider that action correct.
Liking: The propensity to agree with people we like and, just as important, the propensity for others to agree with us, if we like them.
Authority: We are more likely to say “yes” to others who are authorities, who carry greater knowledge, experience or expertise.
Scarcity: We want more of what is less available or dwindling in availability.
Understanding and applying the six principles ethically is cost-free and deceptively easy. Backed by Dr. Cialdini’s 35 years of evidence-based, peer-reviewed scientific research—as well as by a three-year field study on what moves people to change behavior—Influence is a comprehensive guide to using these principles effectively to amplify your ability to change the behavior of others.",22.0,85575.0,92.0,1656.0,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJQ5yYItIFo/hqdefault.jpg,,2023-03-10 09:37:22.948869,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': 0.9829}",0.018,0.138,0.844,0.9829,"{'fear': 0.0, 'anger': 0.0, 'anticip': 0.0, 'trust': 0.0, 'surprise': 0.0, 'positive': 0.0, 'negative': 0.0, 'sadness': 0.0, 'disgust': 0.0, 'joy': 0.0}",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Have you ever wondered about Color theory in Film? 

You film color palette matters to the audience. It’s not only aesthetic, it also affects storytelling. This video takes you through director’s choices when it comes to colorization in their film works and how those colors get different emotional responses from the audience.

We break down color in TV, movie, and use film theory to extract meaning from specific choices. There are three components of color.

They are:

Hue - which is the color. 

Saturation - the intensity of the color

Brightness - the brightness of the color

With just hue, saturation, and brightness (HSB for short) you can create a complex color scheme rather simply, and go from being just another director to a being a true visual artist.

By utilizing hue, saturation, and brightness you can precisely identify the right color create certain feelings in your audience.

Bright images often seem lively and exciting. Darker images often seem dramatic. And on it goes…

But rules were made to be broken.

What are some of your favorite moments of color in media and entertainment?

Expert stock market trader, Tom Hougaard @TraderTom, attempts to change the way you think about stocks and indices trading.

Hougaard discusses dealing with fear when trading, his passion for stock charts, and highlights key levels on historical charts to show where exactly he bought or sold. Hougaard also talks about taking risks, and how to enter large positions by learning to counteract those natural biases.

On Today's Episode:

Social settings either get you hype and excited or they make you think of a thousand other things you’d rather do and any excuse that will get you off the hook from having to go.

When your fear of being around people and having to interact with them costs your dreams, your opportunities, and your growth, you have to do something different.

Vanessa Van Edwards, a.k.a. The recovering awkward person that sold millions of copies of her bestselling books, Captivate and Cues, has more tips than you can remember, so get the pen and paper or your favorite note-taking app ready. Her work with her company the Science of People has been dedicated to helping you learn to stop being awkward, start better conversations, connect with people and understand their verbal and nonverbal cues.

Some key points Vanessa share in this masterclass is:
How to master charisma
Why you want to listen to your gut 
Understanding your level of openness, neuroticism and conscientiousness

Understanding your psychology is just the beginning. Knowing how to interpret cues in different social contexts and when to address them is next level. Vanessa gives away key ips for understanding yourself and the people around you. Warmth and competence is the magic dose to look for.

Captivate: https://amzn.to/3IVvvZh 
Cues: https://amzn.to/3wbVxjt 

QUOTES:

“I would rather you be aware of the cues that are being sent to you to know, ‘I want this or I don't’ because they are that powerful, that if someone has bad intentions, they can still produce trust.”

“This is the challenge we have as cue readers, do you want to address the emotion or the cue?”

“I think that people who doubt their ideas, and they doubt themselves, that leaks in their cues.”

“High neurotics prevent crises from happening in the first place.”

 “I would rather live in hard truth than in ignorant bliss.”

“Charisma is the perfect blend of being likable and powerful.”

“Competence without warmth leaves people feeling suspicious.”

“The best thing you can do is open with warmth, hit them with competence, and end with purpose.

What did Marvel's Moon Knight get right about Dissociative Identity Disorder? Quite a bit, actually!

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright dive into the psychology and mental health in this series, particularly with Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Marc Spector and Steven Grant. This show has amazing visual effects and action scenes, spectacular performances from Oscar Isaac, Ethan Hawke, and May Calamawy, and an entire episode that's almost all about mental health and psychology! (In which Arthur Harrow is somehow actually a really good therapist/psychiatrist.) We talk about how DID is shown with a level of both compassion and accuracy that you don't typically see on screen. Ya know, aside from the superhero elements and ancient Egyptian gods. That's less real. We think...

In fact, there’s always some logic, but most often it hides in certain peculiarities of your mind. The human psyche is a pro at hiding its own secrets. Scientists have been working for years to understand everything about the mind and brain, yet there’s still so much left to find out. 

But you don't necessarily have to be an expert in psychology to understand what's going on in other people's heads and use it to your advantage. There are some psychological tips that work on a subconscious level that help you win another person's trust, get somebody's approval, and relax when you’re stressed out. 

Watch the video till the end to understand why we always want something that is impossible to achieve and why we act one way or another!

SUMMARY:
- After a good joke or in the middle of an interesting discussion, every person instinctively looks at the person they like the most. This is because they want to make sure that the object of their desires approves of and shares their sense of humor.
- People often imagine their memories like short films or video clips. You store them somewhere in the attic of your brain, and they stay there collecting dust and never changing. But this isn't exactly true.
- If you don't like the answer someone has given you, or it seems like they’re not telling you the whole story, just keep staring at them.
- If you have to talk to a lot of people at work, hang a small mirror behind your desk. You’ll be surprised that many people will be more polite and ready to meet you halfway in negotiations. This is because nobody likes to see themselves angry or annoyed.
- The effect when a viewer, after seeing two unrelated frames, unconsciously makes up a logical connection between them is called the Kuleshov effect. 
- Scientists from the University of California are saying that every single day people spend 30% of their time in La-la Land.
- ""Body negative"" is a condition where a person thinks they’re ugly, and this is why their personal life is a fail. And their whole life is a fail. Most often such people are attractive, and the problem is more about self-esteem than real flaws.
- You can't NOT notice 3 things: food, sex, and danger
- Most often we judge a situation only by successful people (""survivors""), and that’s why we know just one side of it.
- Roughly speaking, this is the phenomenon telling that the hard-to-reach is always more desirable. Even if we look at it from a human level: closed, high-status, ""no-one-knows-what’s-on-their-mind"" people always seem more attractive than others.
- Some people feel excessive tension next to beautiful people: excitement, double control of one’s actions, the desire to save face, and fear of comparison. Such stress doesn’t arise next to an average person.

The story of Noah and the Ark is next in the Genesis sequence. This is a more elaborated tale than the initial creation account, or the story of Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel. However, it cannot be understood in its true depth without some investigation into what the motif of the flood means, psychologically, and an analysis of how that motif is informed by the order/chaos dichotomy, as well as by the idea of an involuntary voyage to the underworld or confrontation with the dragon. In consequence, this lecture concentrates almost exclusively on psychology: How is an encounter with the unknown to be understood, conceptually? How and why is that represented with themes such as the underworld voyage, the dragon fight, or the flood? 

All that constitutes the theme of lecture VI.

We talk about the moment of falling in love as if we have been hit by Cupid's arrow – it is intense, overwhelming, sometimes fast and can feel like fate. As time passes, this initial bust of feeling often fades into a comfortable closeness.

The initial happy feelings of being in love is stimulated by 3 chemicals in the brain: noradrenaline that stimulates adrenaline production causing that racing heart and sweaty palms; dopamine, the feel-good chemical; and phenylethylamine that is released when we're near our crush, giving us butterflies in our tummies.

But is there a biological reason behind these feelings? And why do you fall in love with that one person you do?

Research based  psychological facts that will amaze you.

Today we're going to break down a few of Jamie's habits, and how you can use these habits to become funnier, more magnetic, and a more likeable listener.

Mindset - The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck

The updated edition of the book that has changed millions of lives with its insights into the growth mind-set.
After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, PhD, discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mind-set. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mind-set - those who believe that abilities are fixed - are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mind-set - those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.
In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mind-set and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mind-set. She also expands the mind-set concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mind-set, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love - to transform their lives and your own.
Praise for Mindset:
“A good book is one whose advice you believe. A great book is one whose advice you follow. This is a book that can change your life, as its ideas have changed mine.” (Robert J. Sternberg, co-author of Teaching for Wisdom, Intelligence, Creativity, and Success)
“An essential read for parents, teachers [and] coaches...as well as for those who would like to increase their own feelings of success and fulfillment.” (Library Journal, starred review)
“Everyone should read this book.” (Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick)
“One of the most influential books ever about motivation.” (Po Bronson, author of NurtureShock)
“If you manage people or are a parent, which is a form of managing people, drop everything and read Mindset.” (Guy Kawasaki, author of The Art of the Start 2.0)

We talk about the moment of falling in love as if we have been hit by Cupid's arrow – it is intense, overwhelming, sometimes fast and can feel like fate. As time passes, this initial bust of feeling often fades into a comfortable closeness.

The initial happy feelings of being in love is stimulated by 3 chemicals in the brain: noradrenaline that stimulates adrenaline production causing that racing heart and sweaty palms; dopamine, the feel-good chemical; and phenylethylamine that is released when we're near our crush, giving us butterflies in our tummies.

But is there a biological reason behind these feelings? And why do you fall in love with that one person you do?

Research based  psychological facts that will amaze you.

SUMMARY:
- If you want to learn if someone has been looking at you, try yawning. No, it’s not some secret code, but if someone is looking at you and you happen to yawn, they won’t be able to help but yawn themselves. 
- The food serves as a great distraction and can actually relieve tension since you’ll start to care more about the food than what you’re talking about.
- When there’s silence, the other person is more likely to talk and will probably say more than they would if you were to interject. 
- A sure way to stand out from the crowd is to use the “serial position effect.” This is based on the idea that people tend to remember the first and last parts of things and not as much of the middle.
- If you’re in a new relationship or starting a friendship with someone, instead of going to the movies or out to eat, try doing an activity together that can get your blood pumping.
- While you’re talking and getting to know each other, try to point out something you both have in common. Maybe you grew up in the same town or you both have the same alma mater.
- When you meet someone for the first time at a party or work event, say their name right after they introduce themselves.
- Instead of asking the person point blank if they can help, pose a false dilemma. 
- Even if you aren’t sure of something, that doesn’t mean you should question what you say. Try leaving out the word “I think” when you talk to your friends and family. 
- For people to pay attention to what you’re saying, keep direct eye contact with them while you’re talking.

Invaluable lessons about riches, happiness, and managing money are not always about what you know. It's all about how you act. And it is difficult to teach behavior, even to smart people. Managing money, investing it, and making business decisions are all thought to require a lot of calculations, with facts and formulae telling us just what to do. However, people do not make financial decisions on spreadsheets in the real world. They make them over dinner or during a meeting, where personal history, ego, pride, and your perception of the world are all mixed together. Learn the psychology of money, through this fantastic book summary which explores the unusual ways individuals think about money and teaches you how to clearly understand one of life's most significant matters only on BookLand 2.0

Aksar hamare mann mein ye sawal aata hai ki bill gates itne ameer kaise hue? Kaise warren buffett ne apni jyadatar wealth 50 se 60 ki age mein bnai? kya inh logon ne iske liye mehnat ki ya fir ye log sirf lucky the? Aur ameer banne ke liye humein kya karna hoga? Aaiye sunte hain is book summary ko aur jaane kaise sirf apna behaviour badalne se aap ameer ban sakte hain.

हर किसी की पैसे के बारे में सोच अलग है। लेकिन हर कोई खुद को समझदार समझता है। इसलिए लेखक ने कहा है कि अपनी limit समझें। उन लोगों को देखें जिन्होंने जिंदगी में गरीब होने के बाबजूद पैसे बनाये हैं।

Mindset - The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck

The updated edition of the book that has changed millions of lives with its insights into the growth mind-set.
After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, PhD, discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mind-set. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mind-set - those who believe that abilities are fixed - are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mind-set - those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.
In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mind-set and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mind-set. She also expands the mind-set concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mind-set, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love - to transform their lives and your own.
Praise for Mindset:
“A good book is one whose advice you believe. A great book is one whose advice you follow. This is a book that can change your life, as its ideas have changed mine.” (Robert J. Sternberg, co-author of Teaching for Wisdom, Intelligence, Creativity, and Success)
“An essential read for parents, teachers [and] coaches...as well as for those who would like to increase their own feelings of success and fulfillment.” (Library Journal, starred review)
“Everyone should read this book.” (Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick)
“One of the most influential books ever about motivation.” (Po Bronson, author of NurtureShock)
“If you manage people or are a parent, which is a form of managing people, drop everything and read Mindset.” (Guy Kawasaki, author of The Art of the Start 2.0)

Explore accredited online Child Psychology Courses at Brentwood Open Learning College: http://www.bolc.co.uk.

Child psychology studies the various aspects of a human's development throughout childhood. Although child psychology explores infancy, childhood and adolescence, the primary focus is on the earlier years of infancy.Child psychology is a specific branch of developmental psychology, dealing not only with children's physical development, but with their mental, emotional and social development, also.Influences that affect a child's growth involve much more than the mixture of internal forces that arise from within an individual. Environmental factors, such as social relationships and the culture in which a child lives, also play an important role.

A comprehensive analysis of a child's development takes into account many different major contexts:
The Social Background
The Cultural Background
The Socioeconomic Background
From a broader perspective, Child Psychology seeks to answer the following questions:
• What makes one child a leader in her group while the other is timid and stays close to the teacher
all the time?
• Do children, on average, develop various skills and abilities at the same time?
• What, on average, should be expected from a child at different ages?
• Is there a pattern in development by which one can expect a three year old to behave differently
from a five year old?

Certificate in child psychology level 3 outlines information regarding development in children and evolutionary theory. Certificate in child psychology level 3 consists seven insightful units: Introduction to Child Psychology, The Formation of Attachments, Consequences of Attachment Breakdowns, Personality Development, Social Development, Development of Language, Moral Development.

We talk about the moment of falling in love as if we have been hit by Cupid's arrow – it is intense, overwhelming, sometimes fast and can feel like fate. As time passes, this initial bust of feeling often fades into a comfortable closeness.

The initial happy feelings of being in love is stimulated by 3 chemicals in the brain: noradrenaline that stimulates adrenaline production causing that racing heart and sweaty palms; dopamine, the feel-good chemical; and phenylethylamine that is released when we're near our crush, giving us butterflies in our tummies.

But is there a biological reason behind these feelings? And why do you fall in love with that one person you do?

Research based  psychological facts that will amaze you.

Invaluable lessons about riches, happiness, and managing money are not always about what you know. It's all about how you act. And it is difficult to teach behavior, even to smart people. Managing money, investing it, and making business decisions are all thought to require a lot of calculations, with facts and formulae telling us just what to do. However, people do not make financial decisions on spreadsheets in the real world. They make them over dinner or during a meeting, where personal history, ego, pride, and your perception of the world are all mixed together. Learn the psychology of money, through this fantastic book summary which explores the unusual ways individuals think about money and teaches you how to clearly understand one of life's most significant matters only on BookLand 2.0

Aksar hamare mann mein ye sawal aata hai ki bill gates itne ameer kaise hue? Kaise warren buffett ne apni jyadatar wealth 50 se 60 ki age mein bnai? kya inh logon ne iske liye mehnat ki ya fir ye log sirf lucky the? Aur ameer banne ke liye humein kya karna hoga? Aaiye sunte hain is book summary ko aur jaane kaise sirf apna behaviour badalne se aap ameer ban sakte hain.

हर किसी की पैसे के बारे में सोच अलग है। लेकिन हर कोई खुद को समझदार समझता है। इसलिए लेखक ने कहा है कि अपनी limit समझें। उन लोगों को देखें जिन्होंने जिंदगी में गरीब होने के बाबजूद पैसे बनाये हैं।

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- If you want to learn if someone has been looking at you, try yawning. No, it’s not some secret code, but if someone is looking at you and you happen to yawn, they won’t be able to help but yawn themselves. 
- The food serves as a great distraction and can actually relieve tension since you’ll start to care more about the food than what you’re talking about.
- When there’s silence, the other person is more likely to talk and will probably say more than they would if you were to interject. 
- A sure way to stand out from the crowd is to use the “serial position effect.” This is based on the idea that people tend to remember the first and last parts of things and not as much of the middle.
- If you’re in a new relationship or starting a friendship with someone, instead of going to the movies or out to eat, try doing an activity together that can get your blood pumping.
- While you’re talking and getting to know each other, try to point out something you both have in common. Maybe you grew up in the same town or you both have the same alma mater.
- When you meet someone for the first time at a party or work event, say their name right after they introduce themselves.
- Instead of asking the person point blank if they can help, pose a false dilemma. 
- Even if you aren’t sure of something, that doesn’t mean you should question what you say. Try leaving out the word “I think” when you talk to your friends and family. 
- For people to pay attention to what you’re saying, keep direct eye contact with them while you’re talking.

Today on the show, we have with us one of India's most incredible Bollywood actresses Kiara Advani. She is someone who started her career with the film ""Fugly"" and then moved on to deliver one of her all-time super hit films - ""MS Dhoni"". After the release of that film, she gained a massive level of fame and recognition. Since then, she has never been overlooked in the industry. It was my absolute honour to have her on the show. Hoping to bring back Kiara Advani, someone who’s so open-minded, high-spirited & especially a great conversationalist.

In this fantastic episode, we spoke about some of the deepest aspects of both of our lives. From psychology, and personality traits, to opinions on long-term love and relationships. She opened up about her mindset towards Bollywood, acting, her personal brand, life goals & more. Her new movie ""Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2"" is releasing in theatres on the 20th of May'22. Excited to see her on the big screen again.

Kiara Advani’s freshest perspective on relationships, psychology & modern love. Hope you enjoy this raw conversation :)

How To Generate Sexual Tension With ANY Woman – Female Psychology 

Learn how to build sexual tension with a woman. In today's video we're going to be discussing the steps to generating sexual tension with someone. 

Are you looking for a step-by-step guide to creating sexual tension between you and the woman of your dreams? Are you hoping that adding a few new players to your roster will make you more popular with the ladies? If so, then you’ve come to the right place! With the right advice, creating sexual tension can be an easy and enjoyable process. It's not as daunting as you may think, so let's settle your mind right now. We've put together a little beginners guide to creating sexual tension for you, and it's as easy as ABC…

What is sexual tension?
Sexual tension occurs when one or both partners experience sexual desire but do not act on it immediately, if at all. You two seem a little aroused, which creates tension. You are aware of the truth. And it appears that only the two of you are aware of a hot little secret game. So, how do you first engender that desire? Flirting. It takes courage to express romantic interest in a woman. And that self-assurance makes a girl want you even more. Sexual interest is piqued and tension is increased by flirting. And there is a particular kind of flirting that, in my opinion, accomplishes this best: non-verbal flirting.

             अमीर लोग अपने दिमाग से पैसा कमाते हैं, अपने दिमाग से बिजनेस चलाते हैं, अपने दिमाग से दुनिया पर राज करते हैं। गरीब लोग अपने शरीर से पैसे कमाते हैं और अपने शरीर को ही पैसे खिला देते हैं। जिंदगी बदहाली में रहती है और भविष्य भी गरीबी की झलक दिखाता रहता है। अमीरी और गरीबी सिर्फ विचारों का परिणाम है। इसे बदला जा सकता है। 

            दुनिया के 5% लोग दुनिया को चलाते हैं और 95% लोग उन 5% अमीरों से ईर्ष्या करते हुए जिंदगी व्यतीत करते हैं। अमीरों की निंदा करना, बुराई करना, ईर्ष्या करना उनकी आदत बन जाती है। इसलिए गरीबी का आना, बदहाली में जीना, उनकी आदत बन जाती है। अमीर बनना है तो अमीरों से नफरत नहीं, अमीरों से सीखने की जरूरत है। नफरत सीखने से दूर करेगी और गरीबी का जाल बड़ा होता जाएगा। 

           अमीर लोग अपनी जिंदगी की जिम्मेदारी खुद लेते हैं, अपने परिणामों की जिम्मेदारी खुद लेते हैं। इसलिए वे अपने नियम, संस्कार, आदतें और विचारों को बदल पाते हैं। जो जिम्मेदारी ले सकता है वो बदलाव भी कर सकता है। गरीब लोग कभी जिम्मेदारी उठाने की हिम्मत नहीं करते क्योंकि जिम्मेदारी उठाना एक हिम्मत का काम है। अमीर लोग अपने अंदर झांकते हैं और अपनी सोच से दुनिया को दिखा देते हैं कि उनके पास सफलता को झकझोरने की ताकत मौजूद है।

Tonight's high quality ASMR entertainment is the next in the unprofessional ASMR series. Meet Doctor Nicola, the unprofessional ASMR psychologist. This ASMR roleplay isn't scripted & contains some SURPRISES! Some of the things I say are based on my past experiences with Psychologists but have been dramatized for your ASMR entertainment. I've added some ASMR triggers such as ASMR whisper, ASMR writing, ASMR pencil writing, ASMR paper, ASMR tapping & ASMR pen clicking to give you those amazing ASMR tingles. This ASMR doctor ASMR roleplay is purely for your ASMR entertainment; it is funny & it's the perfect escape from reality. This ASMR video is light hearted but If you are easily offended please watch another one of my ASMR videos. 

TW: Main points mentioned are Cheating, Slender man horror movie, santa, cleaning, cheese, ASMR, flying, ocean & sharks.

As a result of this, individuals tend to try to avoid losses in whatever way possible.

Q: How to avoid it then?

➡️No one likes to make a loss, but loss aversion can cause you to lose more money or make less money than what you feared to lose.

- You can avoid loss aversion by not getting too emotionally involved in your investments. There are risks involved in investments, many of these risks are beyond your control and you cannot be right all the time.

Sometimes, it is better to book a loss and move on to alternative investment options. It is difficult to separate emotions from investing, but successful investors are able to do it. A good financial advisor can help you overcome this behavioural bias.

- You should do what is right to meet your financial goals including selling funds that are underperforming consistently and switching to better funds.
